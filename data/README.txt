Each row of the cleaned dataset should be 1150 long. headers.txt represents the headers for each row of 1150. 


champions-cleaned.json is a dictionary that converts the ordered list of champions to their name, and the champion ID used by Riot Games.
This is necessary for interprerting the ID's given by the recommendation system into champion names, and vice versa.


---------!!!!!!!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!---------
For all programs to work properly, you must download the following archive and extract it. You can download the archive from here:

Once extracted, there will be 2 files:
"pre-cleaning-dataset.csv" and "post-cleaning-dataset.csv"
These files should be put in the data folder without being renamend with all the other datasets to ensure that the programs work properly. 
The programs can still work if they are not, but it will be necessary to reconfigure each program.
