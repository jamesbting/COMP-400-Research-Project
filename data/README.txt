Each row of the cleaned dataset should be 1150 long. headers.txt represents the headers for each row of 1150. 


champions-cleaned.json is a dictionary that converts the ordered list of champions to their name, and the champion ID used by Riot Games.
This is necessary for interprerting the ID's given by the recommendation system into champion names, and vice versa.


---------!!!!!!!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!---------
For all programs to work properly, you must download the following files from the following locations:

This file should be put in the data folder and named: "pre-cleaning-dataset.csv"
Pre-cleaning dataset: ohttps://mcgill-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/james_ting_mail_mcgill_ca/EXswNVchIbJAvkMxeqTKEoUBaNGiC1EkTTaR0EnMfO58uw?e=GGjcey


This file should be put in the data folder and named: "post-cleaning-dataset.csv"
Post-cleaning dataset: https://mcgill-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/james_ting_mail_mcgill_ca/EX1g_CIEHrVNpAtBpL1fY2MBCAfs686WCrJNUXQvg14BTw?e=6eeuyy


If this naming convention is not followed, the programs can still work, but the locations of each file must be specified correctly in the config for each program.
