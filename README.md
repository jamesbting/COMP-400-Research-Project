# Using Monte Carlo Tree Search Methods for Real-Time Champion Recommendations in League of Legends

This repository contains all the source code for my COMP 400 research project.  This project aims to demonstrate that a Monte Carlo Tree Search system can make real time recommendations for League of Legends players.  Each sub-project contains a README that describes each project in more detail. Be sure to read it. 

This folder contains the following sub-projects:
data: stores all the different dataset for each project (check README contained in this folder)
data-cleaner: the Python script that cleans the dataset
filtering: the collaborative filtering program
mcts: the implementation of UCT
nn-reward-function: the code for training the neural network
results-calculator: the code to calculate the results 
riot-games-api-scraper: the code for the data collection tool

Each program must be validated correctly to work.
